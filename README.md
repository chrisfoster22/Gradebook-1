# Gradebook

Update 2/9 - Students' achievements are displayed under their names.

This app allows multiple teachers to track their student's grades by assignment. The app also allows both students and parents to log into the system to check the student's grades.

If you would like to access the samples we have included in the app, you can reference the seed.rb which will provide a list of sample users. Depending on the user's authorization rights, they will be limited in what information they can access.
